# dotfiles
A bunch of files that make my life easier as a developer

- nvim config
- zshrc

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
note: i'm trying to make the setup as automated as possible, but some aspects simply require manual input

TODO
- conda setup in .zshrc
- automatic setup from start to finish
- more nvim plugins
- any theme or aesthetic changes to the OS (orchid theme maybe)
- find better suited colors for nvim hop (try to match the demo img maybe)
